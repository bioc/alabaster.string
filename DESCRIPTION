Package: alabaster.string
Title: Save and Load Biostrings to/from File
Version: 1.3.2
Date: 2023-12-29
Description: Save Biostrings objects to file artifacts, and load them back into memory.
    This is a more portable alternative to serialization of such objects into RDS files.
    Each artifact is associated with metadata for further interpretation;
    downstream applications can enrich this metadata with context-specific properties.
